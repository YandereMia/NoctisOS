# NoctisOS

### 🚀 Introduction
Hey, welcome to the **NoctisOS (NoctisOS/NoctisOS)** project!  
This is my New Year 2026 challenge – a fun **year-long OS project** I started so I have something cool to build all year (as long as it's still 2026 😄).

I’ve always loved operating systems and dreamed of making my own.  
My early OS attempts only worked thanks to AI because I couldn't code back then.  
But over time I learned programming, and now I’m building a system that is **100% mine**, written by me, running on **real hardware (bare-metal)**. No tutorials, no frameworks, no base OS – just C, assembly, and chaos. 💀🔥

---

### 🧠 About the OS
- **Name:** NoctisOS  
- **Purpose:** Pure fun, learning, and fighting boredom  
- **Runs on:** Bare-metal (no existing OS, no base, no dependencies)
- **Made with:** ❤️ and low-level suffering
- **Design goal:** Get as far as possible and build something I can be proud of!

### 🧭 Project Goals & Planned Features
> ⚠️ *The list below does NOT describe what I already have.*  
> It only shows what **I plan to implement this year**, and whether it's confirmed, possible, or unlikely.

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Filesystem | ✅ Planned (RAMFS + FAT32 support) |
| Shell | ✅ Planned (~30+ commands minimum) |
| Games | ✅ Definitely planned |
| Text editor | ✅ Planned (nano-like editor) |
| Logging system | ✅ Planned (simple custom implementation) |
| Networking | ❔ Maybe (simplified stack) |
| Setup / Installer | ❔ Maybe |
| Built-in programming language | ❔ Maybe (depends on difficulty) |
| Graphics | ❌ Unlikely (not a priority) |

---

### 📌 TODO Highlights
- Build functional **shell with basic commands**
- Implement **RAMFS and FAT32 drivers**
- Create **nano-style terminal text editor**
- Design my own **lightweight logging system**
- Maybe try basic **networking** if I survive
- Add some fun **terminal games**
- Make this OS go **brrr on real hardware**

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- C (freestanding)
- x86 32-bit Assembly (bootloader + early init)
- GDB + GEF for debugging
- QEMU for testing
- Real hardware boot (when ready 💀)

If you want, I can also generate:
- a **scenecore / hacker-style banner**
- command list section for your future shell
- or badges like: `bare-metal`, `kernel`, `low-level`, `C`, `AUR survivor` etc.
